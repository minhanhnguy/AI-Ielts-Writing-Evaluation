    "Can you be an IELTS examiner to evaluate an IELTS writing task 1 with this following standard description:\nBand 1:\nTask Achievement: Responses of 20 words or fewer are rated at Band 1. The content is wholly unrelated to the task. Any copied rubric must be discounted\nCoherence & Cohesion: Responses of 20 words or fewer are rated at Band 1. The writing fails to communicate any message and appears to be by a virtual non-writer.\nLexical Resource: Responses of 20 words or fewer are rated at Band 1. No resource is apparent, except for a few isolated words.\nGrammatical Range & Accuracy: Responses of 20 words or fewer are rated at Band 1. No rateable language is evident.\nBand 2:\nTask Achievement: The content barely relates to the task.\nCoherence & Cohesion: There is little relevant message, or the entire response may be off-topic. There is little evidence of control of organisational features\nLexical Resource: The resource is extremely limited with few recognisable strings, apart from memorised phrases. There is no apparent control of word formation and/or spelling.\nGrammatical Range & Accuracy: There is little or no evidence of sentence forms (except in memorised phrases). \nBand 3:\nTask Achievement: The response does not address the requirements of the task (possibly because of misunderstanding of the data/diagram/situation). Key features/bullet points which are presented may be largely irrelevant. Limited information is presented, and this may be used repetitively.\nCoherence & Cohesion: There is no apparent logical organisation. Ideas are discernible but difficult to relate to each other. Minimal use of sequencers or cohesive devices. Those used do not necessarily indicate a logical relationship between ideas. There is difficulty in identifying referencing\nLexical Resource: The resource is inadequate (which may be due to the response being significantly underlength). Possible over-dependence on input material or memorised language. Control of word choice and/or spelling is very limited, and errors predominate. These errors may severely impede meaning.\nGrammatical Range & Accuracy: Sentence forms are attempted, but errors in grammar and punctuation predominate (except in memorised phrases or those taken from the input material). This prevents most meaning from coming through. Length may be insufficient to provide evidence of control of sentence forms.\nBand 4:\nTask Achievement: The response is an attempt to address the task. Few key features have been selected. The tone may be inappropriate. The format may be inappropriate. Key features/bullet points which are presented may be irrelevant, repetitive, inaccurate or inappropriate\nCoherence & Cohesion: Information and ideas are evident but not arranged coherently, and there is no clear progression within the response. Relationships between ideas can be unclear and/or inadequately marked. There is some use of basic cohesive devices, which may be inaccurate or repetitive. There is inaccurate use or a lack of substitution or referencing. \nLexical Resource: The resource is limited and inadequate for or unrelated to the task. Vocabulary is basic and may be used repetitively. There may be inappropriate use of lexical chunks (e.g. memorised phrases, formulaic language and/or language from the input material). Inappropriate word choice and/or errors in word formation and/or in spelling may impede meaning.\nGrammatical Range & Accuracy: A very limited range of structures is used. Subordinate clauses are rare and simple sentences predominate. Some structures are produced accurately but grammatical errors are frequent and may impede meaning. Punctuation is often faulty or inadequate\nBand 5:\nTask Achievement: The response generally addresses the requirements of the task. The format may be inappropriate in places. Key features which are selected are not adequately covered. The recounting of detail is mainly mechanical. There may be no data to support the description. There may be a tendency to focus on details (without referring to the bigger picture). The inclusion of irrelevant, inappropriate or inaccurate material in key areas detracts from the task achievement. There is limited detail when extending and illustrating the main points. \nCoherence & Cohesion: Organisation is evident but is not wholly logical and there may be a lack of overall progression. Nevertheless, there is a sense of underlying coherence to the response. The relationship of ideas can be followed but the sentences are not fluently linked to each other. There may be limited/overuse of cohesive devices with some inaccuracy. The writing may be repetitive due to inadequate and/or inaccurate use of reference and substitution. \nLexical Resource: The resource is limited but minimally adequate for the task. Simple vocabulary may be used accurately but the range does not permit much variation in expression. There may be frequent lapses in the appropriateness of word choice, and a lack of flexibility is apparent in frequent simplifications and/or repetitions. Errors in spelling and/or word formation may be noticeable and may cause some difficulty for the reader.\nGrammatical Range & Accuracy: The range of structures is limited and rather repetitive. Although complex sentences are attempted, they tend to be faulty, and the greatest accuracy is achieved on simple sentences. Grammatical errors may be frequent and cause some difficulty for the reader. Punctuation may be faulty. \nBand 6:\nTask Achievement: The response focuses on the requirements of the task and an appropriate format is used. Key features which are selected are covered and adequately highlighted. A relevant overview is attempted. Information is appropriately selected and supported using figures/data. Some irrelevant, inappropriate or inaccurate information may occur in areas of detail or when illustrating or extending the main points. Some details may be missing (or excessive) and further extension or illustration may be needed. \nCoherence & Cohesion: Information and ideas are generally arranged coherently and there is a clear overall progression. Cohesive devices are used to some good effect but cohesion within and/or between sentences may be faulty or mechanical due to misuse, overuse or omission. The use of reference and substitution may lack flexibility or clarity and result in some repetition or error \nLexical Resource: The resource is generally adequate and appropriate for the task. The meaning is generally clear in spite of a rather restricted range or a lack of precision in word choice. If the writer is a risk-taker, there will be a wider range of vocabulary used but higher degrees of inaccuracy or inappropriacy. There are some errors in spelling and/or word formation, but these do not impede communication.\nGrammatical Range & Accuracy: A mix of simple and complex sentence forms is used but flexibility is limited. Examples of more complex structures are not marked by the same level of accuracy as in simple structures. Errors in grammar and punctuation occur, but rarely impede communication \nBand 7:\nTask Achievement: The response covers the requirements of the task. The content is relevant and accurate – there may be a few omissions or lapses. The format is appropriate. Key features which are selected are covered and clearly highlighted but could be more fully or more appropriately illustrated or extended. It presents a clear overview, the data are appropriately categorised, and main trends or differences are identified. \nCoherence & Cohesion: Information and ideas are logically organised and there is a clear progression throughout the response. A few lapses may occur. A range of cohesive devices including reference and substitution is used flexibly but with some inaccuracies or some over/under use.\nLexical Resource: The resource is sufficient to allow some flexibility and precision. There is some ability to use less common and/or idiomatic items. An awareness of style and collocation is evident, though inappropriacies occur. There are only a few errors in spelling and/or word formation, and they do not detract from overall clarity.\nGrammatical Range & Accuracy: A variety of complex structures is used with some flexibility and accuracy. Grammar and punctuation are generally well controlled, and error-free sentences are frequent. A few errors in grammar may persist, but these do not impede communication.\nBand 8:\nTask Achievement: The response covers all the requirements of the task appropriately, relevantly and sufficiently. Key features are skilfully selected, and clearly presented, highlighted and illustrated. There may be occasional omissions or lapses in content.\nCoherence & Cohesion: The message can be followed with ease. Information and ideas are logically sequenced, and cohesion is well managed. Occasional lapses in coherence or cohesion may occur. Paragraphing is used sufficiently and appropriately.\nLexical Resource: A wide resource is fluently and flexibly used to convey precise meanings within the scope of the task. There is skilful use of uncommon and/or idiomatic items when appropriate, despite occasional inaccuracies in word choice and collocation. Occasional errors in spelling and/or word formation may occur, but have minimal impact on communication.\nGrammatical Range & Accuracy: A wide range of structures within the scope of the task is flexibly and accurately used. The majority of sentences are error-free, and punctuation is well managed. Occasional, non-systematic errors and inappropriacies occur, but have minimal impact on communication. \nBand 9:\nTask Achievement: All the requirements of the task are fully and appropriately satisfied. There may be extremely rare lapses in content.\nCoherence & Cohesion: The message can be followed effortlessly. Cohesion is used in such a way that it very rarely attracts attention. Any lapses in coherence or cohesion are minimal. Paragraphing is skilfully managed.\nLexical Resource: Full flexibility and precise use are evident within the scope of the task. A wide range of vocabulary is used accurately and appropriately with very natural and sophisticated control of lexical features. Minor errors in spelling and word formation are extremely rare and have minimal impact on communication. \nGrammatical Range & Accuracy: A wide range of structures within the scope of the task is used with full flexibility and control. Punctuation and grammar are used appropriately throughout. Minor errors are extremely rare and have minimal impact on communication \n\nI will also give you some examples to learn the pattern of IELTS writing task 2:\nExample 1:\nThe pie chart and table could noticed that what reasons are pivotal and essential for demolishing lands.\n\nOverall, as can be seen from the the most effective causes of land degradation is over-grazing by worldwide and it is clear from the table that Europe is a region which have the most impression on the land degradation.\n\nGetting back to details, the first and more importantly reason for demolishing is over-grazing by some domestic animals which its percentage is 35% after that the second reason is deforestation which its percentage is similar to over-grazing approximately (30%),the third reason is over-cultivation that  is roughly a quarter  and the last one is some other reasons that is included a tiny fraction.\n\nAs is illustrated by the table, the most percentage of over-grazing which was the main reason on the pie chart  above is allocated to Oceania which is included some islands such as  Australia and New Zealand; moreover, the enormous percentage of deforestation that was the second reason on the pie chart is relevant to Europe region.\n\nEvaluation\nTask Achievement: 5.0\n4.0 attempts to address the task but does not cover all key features; the format may be inappropriate\n5.0 presents, but inadequately covers, key features\n5.0 there may be a tendency to focus on details\n5.0 presents no clear overview\nCoherence & Cohesion: 6.0\n5.0 presents information with some organization\n6.0 there is a clear overall progression\n5.0 makes inadequate, inaccurate, or over-use of cohesive devices\n6.0 may not always use referencing clearly or appropriately\n7.0 presents a clear central topic within each paragraph\nLexical Resources: 6.0\n6.0 uses an adequate range of vocabulary for the task\n6.0 attempts to use less common vocabulary but with some inaccuracy\n6.0 makes some errors in spelling and/or word formation\n5.0 that may cause some difficulty for the reader\nGrammatical Range and Accuracy: 5.0\n6.0 uses a mix of simple and complex sentence forms\n5.0 attempts complex sentences but these tend to be less accurate than simple sentences\n5.0 makes frequent grammatical errors, and punctuation may be faulty\n5.0 errors can cause some difficulty for the reader\nOverall: 5.5\nExample 2:\nThe chart below demonstrates how people used to travel to work in the year 1996 and 2001 which was held in Grahamston. There are 7 mode of transportation to be selected from: drove by car or truck, private vehicle passenger, walked, bicycle, public transport, other (which comprises taxi, ferry, aeroplanes) . Favourite mode was by the use of the car or truck which got the highest more or less 77% in the year 2001. Still, we could see that in 1996, a little bit less which was 56% but still the highest in that year. Secondly, there was a big difference of 11% (private vehicle passenger) from the use of car or truck in the year 1996 and 2001. The rest were all 10% or less in both 1996 and 2001. In 1996, ‘other’ or public transport were a little bit the same 9%, 10% respectively. While ‘walked’ or ‘walked at home’ are 6% and 5% respectively. ‘Bicycle’ was the least favorite in that time (1996).\n\nEvaluation:\nBand score: 5.0\n\nOne of the main issues here is the lack of paragraphing, but also there are a number of occasions where the vocabulary used is too informal. Also, throughout the report, the writer is very specific with the data (77%, 56% etc) where using a wider range of expressions would have been better. For example, 77% could be ‘just over three quarters of the total’. There are also significant errors with grammar and sentence construction.\n\nOn the positive side, the writer has covered the main points and striking trends, and some of the expressions used are academic.\nExample 3:\nThe first line chart given compares the trend in buying electrical gadgets in a country over a period of 100 years, and the second chart illustrates the amount of time spent on houseworks during one week for one household in the same period of time. Overall, the trend in buying three types of electrical devices, namely, washing machine, refrigerator, and vacuum cleaner was upward. On the other hand the time used for household chores significantly decreased from 1920 to 2019.\n\nAccording to the first graph, while refrigerator had the lowest percentage of slightly above zero, it experienced an upward trend until 1980 when it reached its plateau of 100% and it remained unchanged until 2019. A similar change can be seen for vacuum cleaner with a dramatic surge from 30% to 90% over 60 years. Then it peaked at 100% in 2000. Among these three devices only washing machine ownership percentage fluctuated over time with a slight fall between 1960 and 1980. Considering the second chart, it is evident that each family spent 50 hours per week for tasks like laundry, cooking, and cleaning in 1980. This number, however, experienced a gradual decrease from 1920 to 1980 by around a fall of 14 hours weekly. The trend there moved steadily till 2019 with only 11 or 12 hours.\n\nEvaluation\nTask Achievement: 7.5\n7.0 covers the requirements of the task\n7.0 clearly presents and highlights key features\n7.0 could be more fully extended\n9.0 presents a clear overview of main trends, differences, or stages\nCoherence & Cohesion: 7.0\n7.0 logically organizes information and ideas\n7.0 there is clear progression throughout\n7.0 uses a range of cohesive devices appropriately although there may be some under-/over-use\n9.0 uses referencing clearly and appropriately throughout\n5.0 may not write in paragraphs, or paragraphing may be inadequate\nLexical Resources: 6.5\n7.0 uses a sufficient range of vocabulary to allow some flexibility and precision\n7.0 uses less common lexical items with some awareness of style and collocation\n6.0 makes some errors in spelling and/or word formation\n6.0 they do not impede communication\nGrammatical Range and Accuracy: 7.0\n7.0 uses a variety of complex structures\n8.0 the majority of sentences are error-free\n7.0 has good control of grammar and punctuation but may make a few errors\n7.0 they do not impede communication\n\nOverall: 7.0\n\nExample 4:\nThe bar chart illustrates the average Australian water use in 6 selected cities for last year, while the\npie chart describes the share of water each industry consumed in 2014.\nOverall, Perth had the highest average water use for last year with 300 kilolitres per property,\nfollowed by Adelaide and Brisbane with 240 and 250 kilolitres of property respectively. On the other\nhand, Melbourne and Canberra showed the lowest average water consumption of 150 and 140\nkilolitres respectively.\nTaking a look at the distribution of water use by industries, we can clearly see that Agriculture took\nover two thirds of the entire consumption 67%, followed by households 9%. Water Supply, Sewage\nand Drainage industry consumed the same amount of water as the Electricity sector, 7%. In the same\nway there was no difference between the consumption of Manufacturing and Other industries, with\nboth sectors using 4% of the national water supply. The smallest user was the Mining industry,\naccounting for just 2% of Australian water use.\nTo conclude, the city of Perth and the Agriculture industry had a major impact on the usage of\nAustralian water.\n\nEvaluation:\nThe information on two charts was covered in this well-developed response. The data was\ngrouped correctly and a wide range of vocabulary and sentence structures was used. The\nminor grammatical mistakes (mouse over words underlined in blue shows the corrections)\ncould have been caught at the final proofreading stage. Overall, this report seems worthy of\nBand 8.\n\nThis is the end of the examples.\n\nThe following image is the questions for the topic. The following paragraph is the student’s answer. Please first print out the word count of the essay. After that, review each sentence and only point out if you come across any mistakes and want to modify it. And then give scores to each criteria and also the overall band score. After that, please print out the modified version of the essay and the overall band score of the modified version. Finally, give any suggestions for improvements.\n\n";
